    /* You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your

     son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1. As a good parent, you

      will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that

      number, but excluding zero.

    For example, if n = 10:

    return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] */

     function counting (n) {
         var arr = [];
         for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
             arr[i] = i + 1;
         }
         return arr;
     }

     /* Nathan loves cycling.

    Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

    You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the

     smallest value.

    For example:

    time = 3 ----> litres = 1

    time = 6.7---> litres = 3

    time = 11.8--> litres = 5
    */

     function amountOfWaterDrunk (time) {
         var liters = time * 0.5;
         liters = Math.floor(liters);
         return liters;
     }

     /* Task Overview:
    You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

    cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
    on is the number of people on the bus.
    wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus.
    If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

    Usage Examples:
    >>> enough(10, 5, 5)
    0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
    >>> enough(100, 60, 50)
    10 # He can't fit 10 out of 50 waiting
      */
     
     function enough (cap, on, wait) {
         var result = cap - on - wait;
         if(result >= 0) {
             return "He can git all " + wait + " passengers";
         }else {
            return "He can't fit " + Math.abs(result) + " out of " + wait + " waiting";
         }
     }
