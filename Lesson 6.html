    /* You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your

     son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1. As a good parent, you

      will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that

      number, but excluding zero.

    For example, if n = 10:

    return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] */

    You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the

     smallest value.

    For example:

    time = 3 ----> litres = 1

    time = 11.8--> litres = 5

     /* Task Overview:
    You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

    cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
    on is the number of people on the bus.
    wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus.
    If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

    Usage Examples:
    >>> enough(10, 5, 5)
    0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
    >>> enough(100, 60, 50)
    10 # He can't fit 10 out of 50 waiting
      */

         var result = cap - on - wait;
         if(result >= 0) {

         }else {
            return "He can't fit " + Math.abs(result) + " out of " + wait + " waiting";
         }
     }

     /*Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers

      in the form of a phone number.

    Example:
    createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"

    The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.
    Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!

    /*Task Overview
    Americans are odd people: in their buildings, the first floor is actually the ground floor and there is no 13th floor ('cause of superstition).

    Write a function that given an American floor (passed as an integer) returns the real floor.
    Moreover, your function should work for basement floors too: just return the same value as the passed one.

    Usage Examples
    get_real_floor(1) == 0
    get_real_floor(0) == 0 # Special case to please Europeans
    get_real_floor(5) == 4
    get_real_floor(15) == 13
    get_real_floor(-3) == -3
